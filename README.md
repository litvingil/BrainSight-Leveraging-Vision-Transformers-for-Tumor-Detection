# BrainSight-Leveraging-Vision-Transformers-for-Tumor-Detection
This repository contains the code for a neural network project that aims to automate the process of brain tumor detection and classification using MRI scans. Our approach utilizes the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, and our results are compared against a well-established architecture, the ResNet-50, for performance evaluation.
